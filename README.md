# HDR_Image_Fusion_in_Matlab
Image fusion especially for low light conditions photography, using multiple photographs

Instructions for program execution

To run the program, we have the source photos in the format "# .jpg" where # is numbered from 1 to 7, the larger the number, the 
brighter the photo.
It first asks us to specify how many source images we have:
Specify number of source images. (3-7)
It then asks us if we want light post processing in the final photo, source image balancing in the second output photo is always done, 
regardless of our choice here.
Do you want postprocessing? (Y/N)
Finally, we can keep track of the processing, at any time, and have an idea of the total time.
